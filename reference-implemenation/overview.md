* online bankings
* tipping
* \(book\) marking
* web of reputation
* bounties
* rewards
* bootstrapping existing economies
* bootstrapping existing social networks
* realtime bots
* productivity
* IOUs
* loans
* inter ledger payments
* pay to inbox
* vouchers
* accounting
* time stamping and notary services \(e.g. in space, on the block chain\)
* web contracts
* web mining
