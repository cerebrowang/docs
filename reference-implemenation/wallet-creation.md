# Wallet Creation

### Introduction

We are going to create a wallet that integrates with the lightning network.  A wallet is a multi user distributed ledger.  Our wallets will be public for the the reference implmentation but solid allows private and shared wallets, you just need to change the ACL.

### Prerequisites

The first thing we need is a URI for the wallet.

We will also need a random number in order to create a key and seed for our node.

From that we will create a lightning node.

We will also need a solid pod and webid.

### Process

#### Solid Setup

Pick a container in your pod to create the wall

Follow the instructions to create a wallet

Give the wallet a name

#### Lightning Setup

Convert your entropy into a keypari

Create a seed from your keypair

Set up a lightning node with your seed

Save your public key from the seed

Your node alias must be your wallet URI

#### Record on the block chain

Cost : 1600 satoshis

#### Record in space

Currently only testnet
