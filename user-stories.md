# User Stories

## **Make a Deposit**

> As a user, Alice would like some credits for a given wallet.  She obtains a deposit address, then sends a deposit to that address.  The funds should show up in the CreditChain, and consequently, the Ledger after the transfer is confirmed.

## **Make a Payment**

> As a user, Alice wishes to pay Bob, 10 units for a pizza.  She creates a web credit, and adds a note of "Pizza".  This is then sent to the wallet inbox, and Bob's balance is increased.

## **Make a Withdrawal**

> Withdrawals can be orchestrated by someone in the system with a balance.  It is a bad idea to store any funds on a server, as it invites hackers.  A hot wallet may be a solution but suffers from the same limitation.  A better solution might be have withdrawal requests sent to trusted notaries who verify the size and the request, then process based on cold storage, or a hardware wallet.

## **Paywall**

> As a teacher, Alice wishes to make her educational notes available to fellow teachers. Having put a great deal of effort into it, she would wish to get access to different notes from other teachers in return, or put up a pay wall for new teachers that have not yet prepared notes. Alice will set the price of access, and a license indicating it is not to be shared further. Bob, having obtained some credits on Alice's system purchases the notes, and starts working on his own presentations, which he would like to share in a similar way.



## **Paint a pixel on Lightning Testnet**

> Bob wishes to paint a pixel on the website, [testnet.satoshis.place](https://testnet.satoshis.place/), however does not have a testnet lightning wallet.  Bob acquires some funds on solid from a friend and then decides which pixel to paint.  An invoice is created and the pixel is painted.  Bob's balance is reduced by one satoshi and recorded in the CreditChain.

## **IPFS Pinning**

> The IPFS system is used to store content addressable files.  Peers can 'pin' a file making it globally accessible.  However there is a cost associated with that.  Micro payments could incentivize a user to pin a file and receive an income.

## **Pay for Hosting**

> It may be possible to use the system to pay for the hosting of your wallet or other files with micro payments themselves.  In this way you can get a a bit of storage space and be confident your files will be long lived.

## **Faucet**

> A faucet is a simple tool that allows users to get started with small amounts of currency, for free.  It can be used to test or to buy services to help those without funds.

## **Dynamic DNS Service**

> Dynamic DNS allows you to use a name server to root traffic to your own computer.  It's useful but often a pay service.  Micro payments could allow you to use a name server in order to share files on your laptop, desktop or other device.  A related service could be used to register .solid domains.

## **Smart Proxies**

> Proxies can be used to get files such as a CORS proxy for javascript.  However you may want to throttle how much a given user can take, micro payments could allow a set limit on your proxy.

## Snapshots and Backups

> Incentivize snapshots and backups of data on other pods by paying a fee for storage.
