# User Story : Paywall

### User Story

> As a teacher, Alice wishes to make her educational notes available to fellow teachers.  Having put a great deal of effort into it, she would wish to get access to different notes from other teachers in return, or put up a pay wall for new teachers that have not yet prepared notes.  Alice will set the price of access, and a license indicating it is not to be shared further.  
>   
> Bob, having obtained some credits on Alice's system purchases the notes, and starts working on his own presentations, which he would like to share in a similar way.

### Process

Alice secures some educations material in a folder in her solid pod.  She shares the URI on her website or home page.

Bob's  attempts to access the URI, and receives a response, HTTP 402 - Payment Required.
